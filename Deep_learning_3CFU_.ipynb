This model has a total of approximately 9.5 million parameters, but most of them (~9.2 million) are non-trainable because the embedding layer is frozen. Only around 295,000 parameters are trainable in the rest of the model.\n",

        "In comparison, the Transformer-based model (DistilBERT) I used for transfer learning contains many more trainable parameters and achieved a higher macro F1 score of around 0.88.\n",
